# Quotit

#### AUTHOR **{Maxwell Munene}**

This is a simple WEB application where users may enter a GitHub username into a form, submit it, and see names and descriptions of that person's public repositories. A person can also look for repositories. This project was generated with Angular CLI.


![USER INTERFACE](src/assets/Landingpage.png) (LANDING PAGE)
![USER INTERFACE](src/assets/homepage2.png) (USERS PROFILE)


##Technical Requirements
* Project must contain a well-designed landing page that displays your GitHub information such 	as your username, your profile photos and a list of your repositories.
* Place access key inside the environment.ts file and place it inside the gitignore file.
* Create a HTTP service that uses a promise to make the requests to the GitHub API.
* The HTTP request should be able to search for both GitHub users and GitHub repositories.
* Project must have two classes for the user and repository.
* Project must have a proper routing structure that links a GitHub username to the users GitHub 	repositories.
* Project must have a separate routing module.
* Project must contain a custom directive and a custom pipe.
* Project must be well designed and visually appealing and of portfolio quality.
* Project must have a well-documented README file.
* Project must be deployed and the deployed link should be submitted.


## Setup/Installation Requirements.
* To rebuild this app run **git clone https://github.com/tailorv/Git-Insta.git**  on your command line.


## BDD
* Use the GitHub API (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. to retrieve 	this information. This API allows 5,000 requests per hour with an API key, but only 60 	requests per hour _without_ one. Everyone is therefore required to use their own unique 	key. GitHub refers to these keys as "Personal Access Tokens".

## Technologies Used.
 * ANGULAR
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * BOOTSTRAP
